To ensure performance and stability, Glean enforces rate limits at the deployment, user, and endpoint levels.

### Deployment Rate Limits

Applied across all incoming API traffic:

- **8,000 requests per minute** across all IP addresses
- **100 requests per second** from a single IP address

### User Rate Limit

- **30 requests per second** per user-scoped API token

### Endpoint Rate Limits

Rate limits for specific endpoints per user-scoped API token are as follows:

| Endpoint             | Rate Limit                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| /agents/runs         | 0.5 requests per second                 |
| /autocomplete        | 10 requests per second                  |
| /chat                | 0.5 requests per second                 |
| /feed                | 7 requests per second                   |
| /indexdocument       | 10 requests per second                  |
| /indexdocuments      | 10 requests per second                  |
| /people              | 5 requests per second                   |
| /processalldocuments | 1 request every 3 hours per data source |
| /recommendations     | 0.5 requests per second                 |
| /search              | 5 requests per second                   |
| /summarize           | 0.5 requests per second                 |
| rest of endpoints    | 30 requests per second                  |

Glean uses token bucket rate limiters for user and endpoint-level enforcement. This allows for short bursts of activity while maintaining consistent request throughput over time.

### Handling Rate Limits

If you send too many requests in a short period, the API will respond with an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" error. To handle this gracefully, watch for 429 status codes and implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to gradually reduce request volume.
If your application requires higher rate limits, please contact your Glean account team to see if the rate limits can be adjusted.
