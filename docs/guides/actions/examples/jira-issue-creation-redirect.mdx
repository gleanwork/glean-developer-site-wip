# Jira Issue Creation Using Redirect Action

## Overview

This guide explains how to implement a redirect action that allows users to create Jira issues through Glean Assistant. Unlike execution actions that create issues programmatically, this approach directs users to Jira's native interface with relevant information already filled in. This implementation maintains the familiar Jira environment while streamlining the issue creation process.

This is a **redirect action** that directs users to Jira's issue creation interface with pre-populated fields.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- Administrator access to your Jira and Glean instances
- Understanding of Jira's URL parameter structure
- Access to Jira project and component IDs
- Familiarity with redirect action concepts

## Implementation Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Action Manifest Implementation">
    <p>The action manifest defines the fundamental properties of your Jira redirect action. This configuration establishes how the action behaves within the Glean ecosystem.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Click to expand the action manifest configuration</summary>

    ```json
    {
      "type": "ACTION",
      "name": "JiraCreateTicket",
      "description": "This action allows you to create a new issue in Jira. You can specify the project, issue type, and other details.",
      "enablePreview": true,
      "actionType": "REDIRECT"
    }
    ```

    </details>

    <p>The manifest configuration is intentionally simpler than that of execution actions because redirect actions don't require OAuth authentication or complex server implementations. This simplicity reduces implementation overhead while maintaining functionality.</p>
  </Step>

  <Step title="API Specification Development">
    <p>The OpenAPI specification serves as the blueprint for how Glean Assistant interacts with your redirect action. This specification must clearly define all parameters and their behaviors to ensure accurate field population.</p>

    ```

    </details>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Parameter Configuration Strategy">
    <p>The specification includes carefully designed parameters that guide Glean Assistant in populating the Jira issue creation form. Each parameter serves a specific purpose and includes clear instructions for value generation.</p>

    <h4>Project Identification</h4>
    <p>The project ID parameter (<code>pid</code>) requires specific attention as it determines where issues are created. The specification includes a default value and clear description to ensure proper project targeting. For example, setting "10000" as the Engineering project helps maintain consistent issue organization.</p>

    <h4>Issue Type Classification</h4>
    <p>The issue type parameter uses enumerated values to ensure accurate categorization. The specification maps numeric values to specific issue types, such as 10002 for Tasks and 10004 for Bugs. This mapping ensures that issues are properly classified within your Jira instance.</p>

    <h4>Priority Assignment</h4>
    <p>The priority parameter implements a numeric scale from 1 to 5, with built-in validation to prevent invalid values. This structured approach maintains consistency with Jira's priority system while allowing for flexible assignment based on issue urgency.</p>

    <h4>Content Generation</h4>
    <p>Content-related parameters like summary and description use the <code>x-glean-typehint: "Content"</code> directive to guide Glean Assistant in generating appropriate text. This hint ensures that generated content matches the expected format and style for Jira issues.</p>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Testing and Deployment">
    <p>After configuration, thoroughly test the redirect action before deployment.</p>

    <h4>Testing Process</h4>
    
    1. Test the action with various user queries to verify proper parameter population
    2. Verify that URLs are constructed correctly with all required parameters
    3. Check that redirects function properly and reach the correct Jira interface
    4. Validate that field values are correctly populated in Jira's form
    5. Test with different project types, issue types, and user scenarios

    <h4>Deployment Configuration</h4>
    <p>Once testing is complete, deploy the action to your organization with appropriate access controls.</p>
  </Step>
</Steps>
