# Glean Agent Toolkit

A Python toolkit that makes it easy to integrate Glean's powerful search and knowledge discovery capabilities into your AI agents. Use pre-built tools with popular agent frameworks or create your own custom tools that work across multiple platforms.

## When to Use
- Working with multiple agent frameworks (OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI, Google ADK)
- Need production-ready Glean tools (search, employee lookup, calendar, etc.)
- Want to define tools once and use across frameworks
- Building agents that require enterprise knowledge access

  Official Python toolkit for adapting Glean's enterprise tools across multiple agent frameworks
</Card>

## Framework Support

The toolkit provides adapters for major agent frameworks:

| Framework | Installation | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **OpenAI Assistants** | `pip install glean-agent-toolkit[openai]` | Direct API integration with OpenAI |
| **LangChain** | `pip install glean-agent-toolkit[langchain]` | Rich Python agent ecosystem |
| **CrewAI** | `pip install glean-agent-toolkit[crewai]` | Multi-agent collaboration |
| **Google ADK** | `pip install glean-agent-toolkit[adk]` | Google's Agent Development Kit |

## Available Tools

The toolkit comes with production-ready tools that connect to Glean's capabilities:

- **`glean_search`**: Search your company's knowledge base
- **`employee_search`**: Find employees by name, team, department, or expertise
- **`calendar_search`**: Find meetings and calendar events
- **`code_search`**: Search your company's source code repositories
- **`gmail_search`**: Search Gmail messages and conversations
- **`outlook_search`**: Search Outlook mail and calendar items
- **`web_search`**: Search the public web for external information
- **`ai_web_search`**: Query Google Gemini for AI-powered web information

## Example: Multi-Framework Usage

```python
from glean.agent_toolkit.tools import glean_search, employee_search
import os

# Ensure environment variables are set
os.environ["GLEAN_API_TOKEN"] = "your-api-token"
os.environ["GLEAN_INSTANCE"] = "your-instance-name"

# Use with LangChain
langchain_search = glean_search.as_langchain_tool()
langchain_employees = employee_search.as_langchain_tool()

# Use with CrewAI
crewai_search = glean_search.as_crewai_tool()
crewai_employees = employee_search.as_crewai_tool()

# Use with OpenAI Assistants
openai_search = glean_search.as_openai_tool()
openai_employees = employee_search.as_openai_tool()
```

## Custom Tool Creation

Define your own tools once using the `@tool_spec` decorator and use them across any framework:

```python
from glean.agent_toolkit import tool_spec
from pydantic import BaseModel
import requests

class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
    temperature: float
    condition: str
    city: str

@tool_spec(
    name="get_current_weather",
    description="Get current weather information for a specified city",
    output_model=WeatherResponse
)
def get_weather(city: str, units: str = "celsius") -> WeatherResponse:
    """Fetch current weather for a city."""
    return WeatherResponse(
        temperature=22.5,
        condition="sunny",
        city=city
    )

# Use across all supported frameworks
openai_weather = get_weather.as_openai_tool()
langchain_weather = get_weather.as_langchain_tool()
crewai_weather = get_weather.as_crewai_tool()
```

## Complete Example: Multi-Agent System

```python
from glean.agent_toolkit.tools import glean_search, employee_search, calendar_search
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
import os

os.environ["GLEAN_API_TOKEN"] = "your-api-token"
os.environ["GLEAN_INSTANCE"] = "your-instance-name"

# Create agents with different specializations
researcher = Agent(
    role='Research Specialist',
    goal='Find relevant company information and documents',
    backstory='Expert at searching and analyzing company knowledge',
    tools=[glean_search.as_crewai_tool()]
)

hr_specialist = Agent(
    role='HR Specialist', 
    goal='Find employee information and schedule meetings',
    backstory='Expert at employee relations and scheduling',
    tools=[
        employee_search.as_crewai_tool(),
        calendar_search.as_crewai_tool()
    ]
)

# Define tasks
research_task = Task(
    description='Find information about our remote work policy',
    agent=researcher
)

scheduling_task = Task(
    description='Find the HR manager and check their availability this week',
    agent=hr_specialist
)

# Create and run the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, hr_specialist],
    tasks=[research_task, scheduling_task]
)

result = crew.kickoff()
```

## Key Benefits

- **Framework Agnostic**: Write tools once, use everywhere
- **Production-Ready**: Pre-built tools for common Glean operations
- **Easy Integration**: Simple adapter pattern for different frameworks
- **Consistent API**: Same tool interface across all platforms
- **Enterprise Features**: Built-in support for Glean's enterprise capabilities

## Advanced Usage

### Tool Composition

```python
from glean.agent_toolkit.tools import glean_search, employee_search
from glean.agent_toolkit import tool_spec

@tool_spec(
    name="research_and_contact",
    description="Research a topic and find relevant experts to contact"
)
def research_and_contact(topic: str) -> dict:
    """Research a topic and find experts."""
    
    # Search for documents
    search_results = glean_search.execute(topic)
    
    # Extract mentioned people from results
    mentioned_people = extract_people_from_results(search_results)
    
    # Find employee details
    experts = []
    for person_name in mentioned_people:
        employee_info = employee_search.execute(person_name)
        if employee_info:
            experts.append(employee_info)
    
    return {
        "research_results": search_results,
        "experts": experts,
        "summary": f"Found {len(search_results)} documents and {len(experts)} experts on {topic}"
    }

def extract_people_from_results(results):
    """Extract people mentioned in search results."""
    # Implementation to parse names from document content
    pass
```

### Error Handling and Retries

```python
from glean.agent_toolkit.tools import glean_search
from glean.agent_toolkit import tool_spec
import time

@tool_spec(
    name="robust_search",
    description="Search with automatic retries and error handling"
)
def robust_search(query: str, max_retries: int = 3) -> dict:
    """Search with retry logic."""
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return glean_search.execute(query)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
                continue
            else:
                return {
                    "error": f"Search failed after {max_retries} attempts: {str(e)}",
                    "results": []
                }
```
