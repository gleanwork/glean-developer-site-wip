## Which Approach Should I Use?

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

| Factor | Local MCP Server | Remote MCP Server |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Availability** | <Icon name="Check" /> Available now | <Icon name="Lock" /> Private beta - contact Glean team |
| **Setup** | Install & configure locally | No setup required |
| **Maintenance** | You manage updates & hosting | Glean manages everything |
| **Security** | Runs on your infrastructure | Enterprise-grade Glean infrastructure |
| **Performance** | Depends on your local setup | Enterprise SLA with guaranteed uptime |
| **Available Tools** | `company_search`, `chat`, `people_profile_search`, `read_documents` | Different tool set (details available to beta participants) |
| **Ideal For** | Developers, quick testing, full control | Enterprise deployments, production use |

:::tip Quick Start Recommendation
If you're just getting started or want to test MCP integration, begin with the Local MCP Server. You can always migrate to the Remote MCP Server when it becomes generally available.

## Local MCP Server (Available Now)

The Local MCP Server is a self-hosted solution that you install and run on your own infrastructure. This gives you full control over the setup and allows immediate access to Glean's MCP capabilities.

  Official STDIO (local) MCP server implementation for Glean's search and chat capabilities
  
  [View on GitHub](https://github.com/gleanwork/mcp-server)
</Card>

### Features

- **Enterprise Search**: Access Glean's powerful content search capabilities
- **Chat Interface**: Interact with Glean's AI assistant
- **MCP Compliant**: Implements the Model Context Protocol specification
- **Cross-Platform**: Works with Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and more
- **Easy Setup**: Simple CLI configuration for popular MCP clients

### Available Tools

The Local MCP Server provides the following tools:

#### company_search {#company-search}

Search Glean's content index using the Glean Search API. This tool allows you to query Glean's content index with various filtering and configuration options.

#### chat {#chat}

Interact with Glean's AI assistant using the Glean Chat API. This tool allows you to have conversational interactions with Glean's AI, including support for message history, citations, and various configuration options.

#### people_profile_search {#people-profile-search}

Search Glean's People directory to find employee information.

#### read_documents {#read-documents}

Read documents from Glean by providing document IDs or URLs. This tool allows you to retrieve the full content of specific documents for detailed analysis or reference.
### Configuration

#### Authentication

The local MCP server can authenticate you in one of two ways:

1. Using an OAuth token via device flow or
2. Using a Glean Client API token

We recommend using OAuth whenever possible, for a better user experience and obviating the need to manage token issuance.

See [here for instructions](/api-info/client/authentication/oauth) your Glean administrator can follow to setup OAuth device flow for Glean's MCP servers.

:::info
Currently, our MCP implementation uses the OAuth device flow or API tokens for authentication. While the MCP specification includes [optional authorization mechanisms](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/), we're using a simpler approach for now. Once the OAuth specification is widely adopted in the MCP ecosystem, we plan to implement a fully spec-compliant OAuth-based authentication for enhanced security and user management.
:::

#### Using OAuth

First, make sure your administrator has enabled OAuth device flow for your Glean instance. See [here for instructions](/api-info/client/authentication/oauth).

Then follow the instructions for your IDE integration or Application Integration. When you run the configure command you'll be prompted to go through an OAuth device flow to grant access to your IDE or Application to communicate with Glean on your behalf.

#### Using Client API Tokens

##### API Tokens

To use API tokens you'll need a [user-scoped API token](/api-info/client/authentication/overview). API Tokens require the following scopes: `chat`, `search`, `documents`. You should speak to your Glean administrator to provision these tokens.

            Since MCP [does not mandate a specific tool discovery interface](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/tools/), you may need to explicitly prompt Cursor's AI to use Glean's tools. Try prefixing your questions with phrases like "Using Glean, ..." or "Search in Glean for ..." to help the AI understand which tool to use.

            4. A "Start" button will appear in your `.vscode/mcp.json` file. Click it to start the MCP server
            5. VS Code will prompt you for the instance name and API token when the server first starts

              VS Code has native MCP support with agent mode. You can access MCP tools through the Chat view in agent mode. Look for the **Tools** button to manage available MCP servers and tools.
            :::

            1. Open the Chat view in VS Code (⌃⌘I / Ctrl+Alt+I)
            2. Select **Agent** mode from the dropdown
            3. Click the **Tools** button to view available MCP tools
            4. Try a query like "Using Glean, what's our company's policy on remote work?"
            5. Verify that VS Code can access and search your Glean content

<Steps>
      <Step title="Get Credentials">
        Ensure you have your Glean API credentials ready from the [Configuration](#configuration) section above. You'll need:
        - Your Glean instance name
        - A [user-scoped API token](/api-info/client/authentication/overview)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
        Run the following command to configure Claude Desktop to use Glean's MCP server. This will add a new MCP server to Claude Desktop's settings.

        Using explicit `instance` and `token` flags:
        ```bash
        npx -y @gleanwork/configure-mcp-server --client claude --instance <your-glean-instance-name> --token <your-glean-api-token>
        ```

        Using a `.env` file:
        ```bash
        npx -y @gleanwork/configure-mcp-server --client claude --env <path-to-env-file>
        ```
      </Step>

        :::note
          Since MCP [does not mandate a specific tool discovery interface](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/tools/), you may need to explicitly prompt Claude to use Glean's tools. Try prefixing your questions with phrases like "Using Glean, ..." or "Search in Glean for ..." to help Claude understand which tool to use.

        1. Start a new conversation in Claude Desktop

          }
        }
        ```
        6. Save and close the file
        7. Restart Claude Desktop
